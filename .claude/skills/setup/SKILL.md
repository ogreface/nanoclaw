# NanoClaw Setup

Run all commands automatically. Only pause when user action is required (scanning QR codes).

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Install Apple Container

Check if Apple Container is installed:

```bash
which container && container --version || echo "Not installed"
```

If not installed, tell the user:
> Apple Container is required for running agents in isolated environments.
>
> 1. Download the latest `.pkg` from https://github.com/apple/container/releases
> 2. Double-click to install
> 3. Run `container system start` to start the service
>
> Let me know when you've completed these steps.

Wait for user confirmation, then verify:

```bash
container system start 2>/dev/null || true
container --version
```

## 3. Configure API Key

Ask the user:
> Do you have an Anthropic API key configured elsewhere that I should copy, or should I create a `.env` file for you to fill in?

**If copying from another location:**
```bash
# Extract only the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY line from the source file
grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" /path/to/other/.env > .env
```

Verify the key exists (only show first/last few chars for security):
```bash
KEY=$(grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env | cut -d= -f2)
if [ -n "$KEY" ]; then
  echo "API key configured: ${KEY:0:10}...${KEY: -4}"
else
  echo "API key missing or invalid"
fi
```

**If creating new:**
```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=' > .env
```

Tell the user:
> I've created `.env` in the project root. Please add your Anthropic API key after the `=` sign.
> You can get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/

Wait for user confirmation, then verify (only show first/last few chars):
```bash
KEY=$(grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env | cut -d= -f2)
if [ -n "$KEY" ]; then
  echo "API key configured: ${KEY:0:10}...${KEY: -4}"
else
  echo "API key missing or invalid"
fi
```

## 4. Build Container Image

Build the NanoClaw agent container:

```bash
./container/build.sh
```

This creates the `nanoclaw-agent:latest` image with Node.js, Chromium, Claude Code CLI, and agent-browser.

Verify the build succeeded (the `container images` command may not work due to a plugin issue, so we verify by running a simple test):

```bash
echo '{}' | container run -i --entrypoint /bin/echo nanoclaw-agent:latest "Container OK" || echo "Container build failed"
```

## 5. WhatsApp Authentication

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**

Run the authentication script:

```bash
npm run auth
```

Tell the user:
> A QR code will appear. On your phone:
> 1. Open WhatsApp
> 2. Tap **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
> 3. Scan the QR code

Wait for the script to output "Successfully authenticated" then continue.

If it says "Already authenticated", skip to the next step.

## 6. Configure Assistant Name

Ask the user:
> What trigger word do you want to use? (default: `Andy`)
>
> Messages starting with `@TriggerWord` will be sent to Claude.

Store their choice - you'll use it when creating the registered_groups.json and when telling them how to test.

## 7. Register Main Channel

Ask the user:
> Do you want to use your **personal chat** (message yourself) or a **WhatsApp group** as your main control channel?

For personal chat:
> Send any message to yourself in WhatsApp (the "Message Yourself" chat). Tell me when done.

For group:
> Send any message in the WhatsApp group you want to use as your main channel. Tell me when done.

After user confirms, start the app briefly to capture the message:

```bash
timeout 10 npm run dev || true
```

Then find the JID from the database:

```bash
# For personal chat (ends with @s.whatsapp.net)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@s.whatsapp.net' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"

# For group (ends with @g.us)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@g.us' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Create/update `data/registered_groups.json` using the JID from above and the assistant name from step 5:
```json
{
  "JID_HERE": {
    "name": "main",
    "folder": "main",
    "trigger": "@ASSISTANT_NAME",
    "added_at": "CURRENT_ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  }
}
```

Ensure the groups folder exists:
```bash
mkdir -p groups/main/logs
```

## 8. Gmail Authentication (Optional)

Ask the user:
> Do you want to enable Gmail integration for reading/sending emails?
>
> **Note:** This requires setting up Google Cloud Platform OAuth credentials, which involves:
> 1. Creating a GCP project
> 2. Enabling the Gmail API
> 3. Creating OAuth 2.0 credentials
> 4. Downloading a credentials file
>
> This takes about 5-10 minutes. Skip if you don't need email integration.

If yes, guide them through the prerequisites:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Enable the Gmail API (APIs & Services → Enable APIs → search "Gmail API")
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Desktop app)
5. Download the JSON file and save to `~/.gmail-mcp/gcp-oauth.keys.json`

Then run:
```bash
npx -y @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp
```

This will open a browser for OAuth consent. After authorization, credentials are cached.

## 9. Configure launchd Service

Get the actual paths:

```bash
which node
pwd
```

Create the plist file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.nanoclaw</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>NODE_PATH_HERE</string>
        <string>PROJECT_PATH_HERE/dist/index.js</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>PROJECT_PATH_HERE</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:HOME_PATH_HERE/.local/bin</string>
        <key>HOME</key>
        <string>HOME_PATH_HERE</string>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>PROJECT_PATH_HERE/logs/nanoclaw.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>PROJECT_PATH_HERE/logs/nanoclaw.error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Replace the placeholders with actual paths from the commands above.

Build and start the service:

```bash
npm run build
mkdir -p logs
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
launchctl list | grep nanoclaw
```

## 10. Test

Tell the user (using the assistant name they configured):
> Send `@ASSISTANT_NAME hello` in your registered chat.

Check the logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

The user should receive a response in WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting**: Check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`

**No response to messages**:
- Verify the trigger pattern matches (e.g., `@AssistantName` at start of message)
- Check that the chat JID is in `data/registered_groups.json`
- Check `logs/nanoclaw.log` for errors

**WhatsApp disconnected**:
- The service will show a macOS notification
- Run `npm run auth` to re-authenticate
- Restart the service: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw`

**Unload service**:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```
